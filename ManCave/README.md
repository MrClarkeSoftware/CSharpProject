# ManCave Simulator
REPOSITORY NAME:

Man_Cave_Simulator


Starts off by spawning in a basement. You then pick up the pool que to play 8 ball. If you score more than 5, you hear a knock at the door and a muffled voice asks you to let him in. You play more 8 ball and more scary things start happening (picture frame falls off the wall, light on the ceiling turns red, ect) you hear more scary sounds until you eventually have to play a mini game to survive.
